## Git Bash

When you open Git Bash on Windows it should be opening in a home directory, e.g. on SCOTS `C:\Users\<user id>\`\
On Windows AWB, seemed to be opening in S:

Set user environment variable of `HOME= C:\Users\<user id>` To change this.

## Git Config

We want to make sure our GitHub username and GitHub email are stored in our local config file -- this ensures that when you commit and push changes to GitHub they are properly recorded against your GitHub username for tracking etc. git config

```{bash}
# Check the git config contents
git config --list

# Check which global git config file is being used
git config --list -- show-origin

```
