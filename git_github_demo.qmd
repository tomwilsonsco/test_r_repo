# Setup tasks
## Git Bash

When you open Git Bash on Windows it should be opening in a home directory, e.g. on SCOTS `C:\Users\<user id>\`\
On Windows AWB, seemed to be opening in S:

Set a Windows user environment variable of `HOME=C:\Users\<user id>` To change this.

## Git Config

We want to make sure our GitHub username and GitHub email are stored in our local config file -- this ensures that when you commit and push changes to GitHub they are properly recorded against your GitHub username for tracking etc. git config

```{bash}
# Check the git config contents
git config --list

# Check which global git config file is being used
git config --list -- show-origin

```

# Git Branches
These examples are kept relatively simple by assuming we have a main branch in the repository by default and child working branches created from main. In production systems it is common to have a development or dev branch which people create their working branches from and so main is more projected. Using a dev branch is not necessary if just getting familiar with these workflows.

## Git Branches - Basic commands
```{bash}
# Show existing local branches
git branch

# Create and checkout a new branch
git checkout -b check-type-fn

# Send the new branch to the remote
git push -u origin check-type-fn

# make a change e.g. create a new fn file in functions dir, stage and commit
touch functions/my_checker.R
git add functions/my_checker.R
git commit -m "checker function"

# push the local change into the remote new-multiplier-fn branch
git push
```
Once all required changes have been made in the branch, at this point I would suggest opening a GitHub Pull Request, requesting to merge the changes into main. This gives a GitHub web interface where you might ask others to review the changes.  

Once you are happy with the changes in the Pull Request you can use the Pull Request interface in GitHub to merge them into main. Then you simply need to switch to main locally, pull the changes down and optionally delete the local branch under which you made the changes.  

**Remember locally you will need to git pull the changes that have been merged into main after merging the Pull Request, if you use this method**. It will be necessary to do this before making a new branch from main for further edits.
 
It is not strictly necessary to use a GitHub Pull Request to merge a branch and update the remote (e.g. GitHub hosted repository). For reference these are commands which could be used instead.


```{bash}
# Switch back to main branch (after ensuring all changes in working branch have been committed)
git checkout main

# Make sure your local main branch is up to date by pulling
git pull

# merge new-multiplier-fn into main locally
git merge check-type-fn

# then push the changes merged into main to the remote
git push

# Delete branch from the remote (can just do this in GitHub browser too)
git push --delete origin check-type-fn
```
Whether a Pull Request is used or not it is a good idea to delete the branch in locally if it is no longer required.

## Delete local branch
use -D instead of -d if there are unmerged changes you want to delete the branch
```{bash}
git branch -d check-type-fn

```

# Common issues
## 1. Trying to switch branches locally when uncommitted changes have been made.
### Option 1. Stage and commit the changes. You might not always want to do this however.

### Option 2. Undo the changes you have made locally as you want to discard them:
```{bash}
# use git status to see the uncommitted changes
git status
# If you want to discard changes you have made to a file before staging and committing them use git checkout filename
git checkout functions/my_subtracter.R
```
### Option 3. Stash the changes so they are not lost. You can switch branches and come back to them later.
# use git stash to save them
git stash
# then use git checkout to switch to another branch, e.g this might be main branch
git checkout main
# then do what ever need to in main before switching back to working branch
git checkout my-test
# then git stash pop to bring back saved, uncommitted changes
git stash pop
# you can see them with git status and decide whether to stage and commit, keep working on them etc
git status
```

## 2. A merge conflict when you try to merge branches.
This can be easier to deal with within a Pull Request.
